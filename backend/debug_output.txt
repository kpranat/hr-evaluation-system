  - Rationale JSON: {'technical_evaluation': {'grade': 'Poor', 'reasoning': "The technical evaluation grade is poor due to the MCQ technical score being N/A, with an error indicating it has not been graded yet. Given the technical score is not available, it is impossible to assess the candidate's technical abilities."}, 'soft_skills_evaluation': {'grade': 'Poor', 'reasoning': "The soft skills evaluation grade is poor because the text response evaluation remark is N/A, with an error stating it has not been graded yet. Without a graded text response, it is challenging to evaluate the candidate's soft skills and communication abilities."}, 'psychometric_evaluation': {'grade': 'Poor', 'reasoning': "The psychometric evaluation grade is poor since the match grade is N/A, with an error indicating it has not been graded yet. As a result, it is not possible to determine the candidate's personality fit based on the Big 5 traits provided."}, 'resume_fit': {'grade': 'Poor', 'reasoning': "The resume fit grade is poor due to the resume data not being processed yet, resulting in no information available to assess how well the candidate's resume matches the role implied."}, 'final_decision': {'status': 'No Hire', 'summary': "The final decision is to not hire the candidate at this time, as none of the evaluations (technical, soft skills, psychometric, and resume fit) have been completed, providing no insight into the candidate's abilities or fit for the role. Once the evaluations are completed, a more informed decision can be made."}}
